     <h2> Biography </h2>
     <p> I was born in New York City in the year 2001. I was intoduced to dance at a young age and I've been dancing since then. Dancing has become a part of me and hope to try other types of dances once I finish high school and have more free time. Currently I'm working at chipotle and I really enjoy the work environment. I feel like in order for you to love your job you have to have a good work environment and work with your coworkers as a team. I want to grow in my job cause I actually like the work but still go to school. </p>
